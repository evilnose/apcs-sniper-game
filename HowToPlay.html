				<p style = "font-size:20px">A sniper's job in the army is one of the most important : with just a single shot, he can terminate top secret, highly wanted criminals. Yet, he not only runs the risk of being discovered and killed, but of shooting civilians, especially when he is forced to do so to complete his mission. This game is designed to give you a unique perspective into the job of a sniper and to understand the immense responsibility that comes with the power.

					<p style = "font-size:20px"> It is the year 2117. The world you live in has been discovered and invaded by aliens. These elusive creatures do not aim to cooperate with us; they aim to conquer. Over a series of days, we have been receiving alerts from places all over the globe of excessive amounts of alien activity. Over the course of this game, you will be assigned a location to visit and a mission to complete : take out the aliens. Beware though, the aliens have completely merged into society, so make sure you don't kill any civilians while trying to complete your missions.</p>

					<tr>
						<td>1. In each mission, you will be presented with scenes where aliens are mingling with civilians. The target aliens can be differentiated with civilians because they have a red circle around their head. Your job is to find your targets,and kill them.
						</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td><br>2. To shoot an object, position the center of your scope within the  circle of its head and press the mouse. The number of bullets left in each magazine and the number of magazines left are displayed at the top right corner. When you have no bullets left, press 'r' to reload your rifle.
						</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td></br> 3. To get a closer look at any target, press 'z' to zoom. Press 'z' once again to unzoom.
						</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td></br> 4. The mission is considered to be won when no target is left in the scene. If any civilian is shot, or any target runs out of the scene or no bullets remain, the mission is lost. Every time you start the game, the data of the previous won and lost levels will be loaded. At the end of a game, progress data will be stored.
						</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td></br> Some people in the scene are quite sensitive to gunshot sounds. Some of them may get startled if you shoot and may start running. Beware of this fact and be strategic when deciding the order in which you want to shoot. Their posture reveals whether they will stay in the same place, or run awry when the gun fires.
